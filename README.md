> The latest release of Orion-LD is [1.6.0](https://github.com/FIWARE/context.Orion-LD/releases/tag/1.6.0) from July 2024

Orion-LD is a Context Broker and [CEF](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/About+us)
[building block](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/egovernment/solution/cef-context-broker) for context data
management, implementting both the [NGSI-LD API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGSI-LD) and the
[NGSIv2 API](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2). It is currently a fork of the original
[Orion Context Broker](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion) extending support to add **NGSI-LD** and linked
data concepts. Orion-LD follows the [ETSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETSI) specification for **NGSI-LD** and has
been tested to be a stable and fast **NGSI-LD** broker with near compliance to the version 1.6.1 of the NGSI-LD API
specification (and some features from newer releases).

### Are there any legal issues with AGPL 3.0? Is it safe for me to use?
There is absolutely no problem in using a product licensed under AGPL 3.0. Issues with GPL
(or AGPL) licenses are mostly related with the fact that different people assign different
interpretations on the meaning of the term “derivate work” used in these licenses. Due to this,
some people believe that there is a risk in just _using_ software under GPL or AGPL licenses
(even without _modifying_ it).

For the avoidance of doubt, the owners of this software licensed under an AGPL-3.0 license
wish to make a clarifying public statement as follows:

> Please note that software derived as a result of modifying the source code of the
> software in order to fix a bug or incorporate enhancements IS considered a derivative
> work of the product. Software that merely uses or aggregates (i.e. links to) an
> otherwise unmodified version of existing software IS NOT considered a derivative work.

## Contribution to Orion-LD
Anyone wishing to contribute to Orion-LD, be it fixing/adding documentation, tests, source code, all types of contributions are welcome.
For source code contributions, please see the [Contribution guidelines](doc/manuals/contribution_guidelines.md).


## General Information on NGSI-LD
**NGSI-LD** is an an extended subset of [JSON-LD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-LD) for use with context management systems.
Its payloads are encoded as [linked data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) using JSON.

The NGSI-LD Specification is regularly updated and published by ETSI.
The latest specification is [version 1.8.1](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/CIM/001_099/009/01.08.01_60/gs_cim009v010801p.pdf), published in March 2024.
The next release, version 1.9.1, is expected for September/October 2024·

A few presentations on NGSI-LD:
* [NGSI-LD Overview](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tgh6gBdcZHRPU_ehM7M5rGCI83CrYimCwJXxzRI5GDg)
* [NGSI-LD in 30 min](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1z1IzikB7NxIkihDosV4KrtNS_IJUdrNiwC_b4wAI0rc)
* [NGSI-LD in a Nutshell](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14aoHGYzmfn_a31ByG_Tf8pejuP6oWhjqhraLsPtRp_k)

Examples of **NGSI-LD** payloads can be found in [ETSI](https://forge.etsi.org/gitlab/NGSI-LD/NGSI-LD/tree/master/examples).
See also the [OpenAPI Specification of NGSI-LD](https://forge.etsi.org/swagger/ui/?url=https://forge.etsi.org/rep/cim/ngsi-ld-openapi/-/raw/1.7.1/ngsi-ld-api.yaml).  
That is for version 1.7.1 of the NGSI-LD API specification.  
We're currently working on updating this to v1.8.1, ETA: Dec 2024.

If you are not sharing your data across systems and have no need for linked data concepts, then the current stable
version of **NGSI** (**NGSI-v2**) is more than sufficient.
If so, please use the original [Orion](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion) instead of Orion-LD (note that Orion-LD is **not** up-to-date with Orion in terms of NGSI v2).

## NGSI-LD Context Broker Feature Comparison
An Excel file detailing the current compatibility of the development version of the Orion-LD Context Broker against the features (up to v1.8.1) of the API specification can be downloaded [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18tq0_PZFl5WCfYUElcdI6M3Vlin4hP-M).


## Test and Deployment of Orion-LD
If you want to start testing Orion-LD, the most common option is to use Docker.
There are a number of docker images to choose from.

If you (at your own risk) want to evaluate the bleeding edge development changes, you can use the latest image:
`docker run fiware/orion-ld:latest` or better: use
[docker compose](https://github.com/FIWARE/context.Orion-LD/blob/develop/docker/docker-compose.yml) to run it.

The use of the "latest" tag is NOT RECOMMENDED, as it keeps changing. Please don't use it. It's solely meant for internal testing.
The recommendation is to use the newest fixed tag you find and stick to it until you have need for some newer feature/fix and then change to that newer fixed tag.
Every merged pull request results in a new fixed tag in dockerhub/quay.io.

Please note that for production and/or performance implementations, there is a thorough guide for that right [here](https://github.com/FIWARE/load-tests)

If you want to use a more stable image, the latest release (as of July 2024) is
[1.6.0](https://github.com/FIWARE/context.Orion-LD/releases/tag/1.6.0)

```console
docker run quay.io/fiware/orion-ld:1.6.0
```

Please check [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/fiware/orion-ld?tab=tags) or [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fiware/orion-ld/tags) for other releases.

A Test Suite for NGSI-LD compliant brokers can be found [here](https://github.com/fiware/NGSI-LD_Tests).
This test suite is deprecated in favor of the newer [ETSI NGSI-LD API Conformance Test Suite](https://forge.etsi.org/rep/cim/ngsi-ld-test-suite).
(Orion-LD passes about 95% of the test cases of this older deprecated test suite.)

About the ETSI funded conformance test suite, a third TTF (Testing Task force) is currently in progress, to improve on overall coverage and to
aggregate conformance tests for distributed operations.
This third TTF is expected to finish in February 2025 and by then, the ETSI NGSI-LD conformance test suite should be fully operational,
and thus test results for Orion-LD can and will be published.
